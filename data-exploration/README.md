## Overview

The Data Exploration dashboard provides a view of the data in article_warehouse.
It shows the distribution of commonly used fields, such as the in-house ML
fields, like policy stage, importance, sentiment, and sector.

At the top is the documents count by date, and below are different cuts of data.

## Using the Dashboard

This dashboard does not follow a rigid structure like the other ones, since it
is more exploratory in nature. I think this dashboard is useful for looking at
individual visualizations, and screenshotting them to share with others, or
using it as a jumping off point for further analysis.

## Contributing (or making your own dashboard)

Feel free to duplicate the dashboard and make your own.

To do so:

1. Click on "Duplicate" in the top-right corner.
2. Name your dashboard, and under tags, I recommend adding your own name, like
   "owner:david" to denote to others that you are the owner of the search.
